Font properties
Font is an extremely important part of how you communicate content to your user. As you are likely aware there are many different aspects to font, and with CSS you can explicitly style each aspect. Here is a quick reference for what the fonts look like with different properties.

font-family
p {
   font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;
}
This property sets the font face. There are a collection of Web safe fonts that generally each browser has agreed to support, but there is an infinite number of different fonts. The problem is they might not all look the way you want them to on different browsers.

That is why this property "font-family" allows a list of fonts in the order of your preference. This comma-separated list orders your font preference from left to right. In our above example, our first choice is Helvetica, if the browser doesn't support that it will move to the next on the list, Verdana, and if it still doesn't support that it will just pick any sans-serif font it does support. You should always end your font family with fonts that are likely to be supported by the browser, this way you are guaranteed to have control over the font-family.

Something to keep in mind: some fonts have names with multiple words like "Times New Roman" or "Century Gothic". When using these fonts you'll need to surround the entire name with quotes so the browser understands that is a single font name like so:

p {
   font-family: "Times New Roman", "New Century Schoolbook", serif;
}

font-size
h1 {
   font-size: 2.5em;
}
Font-size sets the overall scale of your text. You can use a lot of different units to set the font size. Some of these units you are probably familiar with if you have used text editors before such as pt size or you can use px size. However, these methods are not advised because they are static and will not adapt based on screen size. 

The ideal way to set text size is to use "em". Em is a way to set your text size based on the system settings of the device in which you are viewing that font. This becomes especially important for users who have special font preferences due to accessibility requirements. To use em do not set font-size on the body tag, but instead set the size for each element in relation to the user's default. For example, 1em is the default, 2em is twice as big, 0.5em is half as big etc. Here are some more font sizing tips and tricks.

font-weight
p {
font-weight: bold;
}
The weight of a font is the thickness of the letters. You can set this property using keywords with which you might be familiar: bold, normal or lighter. You can also set this property more specifically using numerical values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 or 900. Normal is represented as 400, whereas bold is 700.

Note that few fonts have settings for all values. If the value is not available, the browser will use the nearest available one. For example, if 800 is not available but 700 is, then the browser will display 700. You can try out different fonts in this code pen to see how they look at each weight setting.

Documentation

font-style
p {
   font-style: italic;
}
The font style property adjusts the angle of the letters in relation to the horizontal plane. Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are typically sloped versions of the regular face.

Documentation

text-decoration
p {
   text-decoration: underline;
}
Text-decoration adds a line across your text. You can set this line to be underneath your text, underline, through your text, line-through, or on top, overline.
